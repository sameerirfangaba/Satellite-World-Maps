                            Granting this permission is optional; core remote functions remain available without it.

                            The app only checks Wi-Fi connection status to enable device discovery and pairing. We do not store or transmit your Wi-Fi network SSID, passwords, or other network credentials.<br>
                            If your phone includes an Infrared (IR) blaster, the app detects its presence to enable infrared remote control.<br>
                            No personal or device-identifying information is collected during this check.
